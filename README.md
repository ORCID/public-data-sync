## ORCID public data sync

The public data sync contains a snapshot of all public data in the ORCID Registry associated with any ORCID record that was created or claimed by an individual. 

These are Python scripts, based on the Amazon AWS CLI API; it is just a reference implementation intended to show ORCID members how to access the public data sync on demand allowing them to be up to date with the latest public data in the ORCID registry.

Members can create their own implementation using the different APIs that Amazon provides to access S3: 

| API | URL |

| CLI | http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html |
| REST API | http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html |
| Python SDK | https://aws.amazon.com/es/developers/getting-started/python/ |

## Technical description

These scripts will synchronize a given folder with the latest content available in the [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) ORCID data sync repository. The download.py script will fetch all public content available, the sync.py script will sync the content modified since the last time the download.py or the sync.py script ran, since a given number of days back, or since the last 30 days if none of the options is provided.

When the synchronization process starts, the script will create a set of folders that will contain all ORCID records distributed by the [checksum](http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780-structure-of-the-orcid-identifier) of the ORCID ID.

## Quick setup

1. Contact the ORCID team at [support@orcid.org](mailto:support@orcid.org) requesting a set of [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) credentials to access the ORCID public record script.

2. Install [python 2.7.6+](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

3. Install the [python PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) module

4. Install script dependencies:
  * pip2 install -r public-data-sync/requirements.txt

5. Configure your [Amazon AWS credentials](https://aws.amazon.com):

  * AWS Access Key ID: Provided by ORCID
  * AWS Secret Access Key: Provided by ORCID
  * Default region name: Your region, see [Specifying AWS Regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-installing-specifying-region.html) for more information
  * Default output format: XML
  * For more information see [Configure Amazon AWS credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-using-examples)

6. Verify you have at least 250GB available in your hard drive to store the ORCID public data sync
 
## Running the script download.py script

Objective: This script will fetch all public content available at the time it ran

Script params: 

* Required:
   * p: Local path where you want to place the ORCID data dump
* Optional:
   * s: Use it to sync summaries
   * a: Use it to sync activities
   * t: Use it to create a compressed directory (.tar.gz) for each of the types (activities or summaries) you are syncing 

Start the sync process providing at least the path parameter and -s or -a
   
Examples:    

python download.py -p `<PATH>` -s

This will sync all summaries and put them under the `<PATH>` directory inside a folder called `summaries`

python download.py -p `<PATH>` -s -a

This will sync all activities and summaries and put them under the `<PATH>` directory, the summaries will be inside a folder called `summaries` and the activities will be inside a folder called `activites`

After this process finishes, there will be a config file called `last_ran.config`, which will contain the time this process started.

## Running the script sync.py script

Objective: This script will fetch the public content available at the time it ran and that was modified after a given time

Script params: 

* Required:
   * p: Local path where you want to place the ORCID data dump
* Optional:
   * s: Use it to sync summaries
   * a: Use it to sync activities
   * t: Use it to create a compressed directory (.tar.gz) for each of the types (activities or summaries) you are syncing 
   * d: Use it to indicate the number of days in the past the record will sync, it is not required and if missing, the system will use the `last_ran.config` file to determine which files it have to sync

Start the sync process providing at least the path parameter and -s or -a
   
Examples:    

python sync.py -p `<PATH>` -s

This will sync summaries and put them under the `<PATH>` directory inside a folder called `summaries`

python sync.py -p `<PATH>` -s -a

This will sync activities and summaries and put them under the `<PATH>` directory, the summaries will be inside a folder called `summaries` and the activities will be inside a folder called `activites`

After this process finishes, there will be a config file called `last_ran.config`, which will contain the time this process started.

## Q&A

+ How do I get a set of credentials to use the data sync?

Contact the ORCID team at [support@orcid.org](mailto:support@orcid.org). In the message state you are requesting a set of Amazon AWS credentials to access the ORCID public data sync script. The ORCID team will confirm your access to the script and provide instructions for accessing the credentials via Passpack (the same method used when issuing ORCID API credentials) or encrypted email.

+ Who can use the data sync process?

The data sync process is available to ORCID Premium members. If you are unsure of your organization's membership status contact [support@orcid.org](mailto:support@orcid.org) 

+ How long does the data sync process takes?

That will depend on you hardware configuration and the bandwidth you have, however, the process could be faster by increasing the [number of concurrent elements](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/s3-config.html) synced at the same time.
